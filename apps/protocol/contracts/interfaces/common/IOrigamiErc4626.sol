/**
 * @title Origami ERC-4626
 * @notice A fork of the openzeppelin ERC-4626, with:
 *  - `_decimalsOffset()` set to zero (OZ defaults to zero anyway)
 *  - Always has decimals() of 18dp (rather than using the underlying asset)
 *  - Deposit and Withdraw fees, which are taken from the _shares_ of the user,
 *    benefiting the existing vault holders.
 *  - Permit support
 *  - IERC165 support
 *  - Reentrancy guard on deposit/mint/withdraw/redeem
 *  - maxRedeem & maxWithdraw for address(0) returns the total vault capacity (given any caps within the implementation) 
 *    which can be withdrawn/redeemed (rather than always returning zero)
