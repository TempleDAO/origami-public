     * of Pool shares). This can be encoded in the `userData` argument, which is ignored by the Vault and passed
     * directly to the Pool's contract, as is `recipient`.

    // constant product one popularized by Balancer V1. Swap costs are smaller compared to general Pools, and are

    // minimal swap info Pools, these are called via IMinimalSwapInfoPool.
